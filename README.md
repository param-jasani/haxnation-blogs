## 🔐 Security Model

This repository enforces a **strict review-driven contribution model**:

1. **Direct pushes to `main` are disabled** via branch protection rules
2. All posts must be submitted via **Pull Request from a fork**
3. Automated checks validate:
   - Author is in the **authorized writers list** (trial) or **GitHub Team** (production)
   - All changed files are **under the author's own folder** (`blog/<username>/`)
4. A designated **blog-reviewer** must approve the PR before it can be merged
5. Merged PRs **automatically trigger deployment** to GitHub Pages

---

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployed automatically to [GitHub Pages](https://haxnation.github.io/blog/) on every merge to `main`.
